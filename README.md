# Overview

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

This app tracks your goals completion by making it so that you can give your goals values and get the points for completeing them. Just Type the name, how much its worth, and if you've completed it, which you can go back and do at a later date

{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}

I think this app it useful for motivation and can help those who have a hard time finding value in completeing their goals without a silly number attached to it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

I really need to get rid of the mail button, as it crashes the program
I also would like for it to save the goals onto the phone
I need to add partials to the goal, that give it the ability to get points in fractions (half the goal is worth half the points, (point value / segments))
